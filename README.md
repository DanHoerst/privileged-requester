This GitHub Action will automatically approve pull requests based off of requester criteria defined in the target repository.

## Workflow Configuration

The workflow should be configured like:

> Where `vX.X.X` is the latest release version found on the releases page

```yaml
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # checkout the repository
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # run privileged-requester
    - uses: github/privileged-requester@vX.X.X
```

See the example in [the workflow folder](.github/workflows/privileged-requester.yml)

## Requester Configuration

In the target repo, the privileged requester functionality should be configured like so:

```yaml
---
requesters:
  dependabot[bot]:
    labels:
      - dependencies
      - github_actions
```

See the example in the [config folder](config/privileged-requester.yaml).

The location of this file in the target repo should be the path used in the workflow configuration `path`

## Reviewer

This Action runs, by default, with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and so approves the PRs as the `github-actions[bot]` user.

However, you can configure the Action to run with a different repo scoped token - a bot user of your own - by defining the Workflow configuration option `robotUserToken` pointing to the repo secret for that token.

## Configuration

Here are the configuration options for this Action:
